    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound uncooked spaghetti</li>
      <li>6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
      <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh italian parsley</li>
      <li>1 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in
        the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm
        to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain and transfer to a pasta bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine garlic and olive oil in a cold skillet. Cook over medium heat to
        slowly toast garlic, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low when
        olive oil begins to bubble. Cook and stir until garlic is golden brown,
        about another 5 minutes. Remove from heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir red pepper flakes, black pepper, and salt into the pasta. Pour in
        olive oil and garlic, and sprinkle on Italian parsley and half of the
        Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese; stir until combined.
      </li>
      <li>Serve pasta topped with the remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.</li>
